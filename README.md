SpaceX Launch Data Analysis Project
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing SpaceX launch data by using API requests to collect data from SpaceX and web scraping for additional data. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying machine learning models to predict the success of Falcon 9 rocket landings.
Data Collection

    The dataset is retrieved using the SpaceX API.
    Additional data is collected using web scraping techniques from a Wikipedia page about Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.

Main Features

    API requests to retrieve rocket, payload, launchpad, and cores data.
    Web scraping to extract launch records from Wikipedia.
    Data preprocessing and cleaning.
    Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations like scatter plots, line plots, and histograms.
    Machine learning models applied: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Tools and Libraries

    Python: Core programming language.
    Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    Requests: API data collection.
    BeautifulSoup: Web scraping.
    Seaborn/Matplotlib: Data visualization.
    Scikit-learn: Machine learning models.
    SQLAlchemy: Database interaction
